<h1>TEXT SUMMARIZATION</h1><br>
<p>Text summarization is a very useful and important part of Natural Language Processing (NLP). First let us talk about what text summarization is. Suppose we have too many lines of text data in any form, such as from articles or magazines or on social media. We have time scarcity so we want only a nutshell report of that text. We can summarize our text in a few lines by removing unimportant text and converting the same text into smaller semantic text form.
Now let us see how we can implement NLP in our programming. We will take a look at all the approaches later, but here we will classify approaches of NLP.
